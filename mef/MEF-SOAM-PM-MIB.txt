        Measurement Interval indices are assigned sequentially by

        the session is started is assigned index 1.  Measurement Intervals
        for availability (stored in this table) are based on
        mefSoamLmCfgAvailabilityMeasurementInterval and are indexed independently
        of Measurement Intervals for FLR (stored in mefSoamLmHistoryStatsTable).

        Referential integrity is necessary, i.e., the index needs to be
        persistent upon a reboot or restart of a device.  The index
        is never reused while this session is active until it wraps to zero.
        The index value keeps increasing up to that time.

       "The index for the Measurement Interval within this
        PM session.

        Measurement Interval indices are assigned sequentially by
        the SNMP Agent.  The first Measurement Interval that occurs after
        the session is started is assigned index 1. Measurement Intervals
        for FLR (stored in this table) are based on
        mefSoamLmCfgMeasurementInterval and are indexed independently
        of Measurement Intervals for availability (stored in
        mefSoamLmHistoryAvailStatsTable).

        Referential integrity is necessary, i.e., the index needs to be
        persistent upon a reboot or restart of a device.  The index
        is never reused while this session is active until it wraps to zero.
        The index value keeps increasing up to that time.

        Each row in the table is automatically created when the Delay
        Measurement session is defined for the selected MEP. The number of rows
        created is based upon three items: the DM type, the number of bins
        defined for each type, and whether bins are enabled for each type.

        The first four indices are the same as used to create the DM session:
        Maintenance Domain, Maintenance Association, MEP identification, and
        mefSoamDmCfgIndex. The fifth index is the type of bin, and the sixth
        index is the bin number.

        For a dmDmm session all nine types of bins can be created. For a dm1DmmTx
        session no bins are created. For a dm1DmmRx session only types
        forwardFrameDelay, forwardIfdv, and forwardFrameDelayRange can be created.

        The number of bins created for a bin type is based upon: the
        mefSoamDmCfgNumMeasBinsPerFrameDelayInterval object, the
        mefSoamDmCfgNumMeasBinsPerInterFrameDelayVariationInterval object, the
        mefSoamDmCfgNumMeasBinsPerFrameDelayRangeInterval object, and
        the mefSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable object.

        For instance, if a dmDmm session with Bins per Frame Delay Interval
        set to 5, Bins per Frame Delay Variation Interval set to 3, and Frame
        Delay Range set to 2 (default), all of the appropriate bits set in
        mefSoamDmMeasurementCfgEnable, the following number of rows would be
        created:

        For bin types TwoWayFrameDelay(1), forwardFrameDelay(2), and
        backwardFrameDelay(3) = 5 bins * 3 types = 15 rows

        For bin types TwoWayIfdv(4), forwardIfdv(5), backwardIfdv(6) =
        3 bins * 3 types = 9 rows.

        For bins types twoWayFrameDelayRange(7), forwardFrameDelayRange(8),
        backwardFrameDelayRange(9) =
        2 bins * 3 types = 6 rows.

        This gives a total of 30 rows created for the DMM session example.

        Each value in the bin defaults to 5000us greater than the previous bin,
        with the first bin default value set to 0.

        For the delay example above (5 bins), the following default values
        would be written to the bins:
              bin 1:     0  (range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us)
              bin 2:  5000  (range is 5,000us <= measurement < 10,000us)
              bin 3: 10000  (range is 10,000us <= measurement < 15,000us)
              bin 4: 15000  (range is 15,000us <= measurement < 20,000us)
              bin 5: 20000  (range is 20,000us <= measurement < infinity)

        For the delay variation example above (3 bins), the following default
        values would be written to the bins:
              bin 1:     0  (range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us)
              bin 2:  5000  (range is 5,000us <= measurement < 10,000us)
              bin 3: 10000  (range is 10,000us <= measurement < infinity)

        For the frame delay range example above (2 bins), the following default
        values would be written to the bins:
              bin 1:     0  (range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us)
              bin 2:  5000  (range is 5,000us <= measurement < infinity)

        The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot
        or restart of a device.

        Rows are only created if the corresponding measurement type has been enabled
        via the mefSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable object.

        of the Maintenance Domain, Maintenance Association, and MEP tables. The
        fourth index is the specific LM session type on the selected MEP. The
        fifth index is the specific LM session on the selected MEP. The sixth
        index is the specific TCA for a PM metric.

        Rows in this table are not created automatically. A row is created in
        this table to set up a TCA on a configured MEP that has a configured
        LM session for a specific PM metric. The row number used to create
        a new TCA is indicated by the mefSoamLmCfgTcaNextIndex object.

        An NE needs to support at least one TCA per metric per PM session for
        NE SOAM PM compliance. More than on TCA per metric per PM session can
        be supported on the NE.

        In order to enable a threshold measurement the
        mefSoamLmThresholdCfgEnable object is to be set to 'True', TCA is
        enabled and the selected TCA has to have a threshold value configured.
        Non-configured TCA measurements are disabled by default.

        The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot
        or restart of a device.

           mefSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable for a LM TCA or

        c) the TCA type is enabled via the mefSoamLmTcaCfgEnable
           or mefSoamDmTcaCfgEnable; and

        d) the measured value of the parameter exceeds the value configured in
           the mefSoamLmTcaCfgThresholdValue for a LM TCA or
           mefSoamDmTcaCfgThresholdValue for a DM TCA; and

        e) no previous TCA notifications with type
           'stateless' has been sent relating to the same threshold
           in the mefSoamLmTcaCfgTable or mefSoamDmTcaCfgTable during this
           Measurement Interval.

        For a TCA SET (statefulSet) five conditions need to be met:

        a) measurement of the parameter is enabled via the
           mefSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable for a LM TCA or
           mefSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable for a DM TCA; and

        b) the parameter threshold is configured in the mefSoamLmTcaCfgTable
           for LM TCA or mefSoamDmTcaCfgTable for DM TCA; and

        c) the TCA type is enabled via the mefSoamLmTcaCfgEnable
           or mefSoamDmTcaCfgEnable; and

        d) the measured value of the parameter exceeds the value configured in
           the mefSoamLmTcaCfgThresholdValue for a LM stateful entry or
           mefSoamDmTcaCfgThresholdValue for a DM stateful entry for this
           Measurement Interval; and

        e) the measured value during the previous measurement interval did not
           exceed the value configured in the mefSoamLmTcaCfgThresholdValue for
           a LM stateful entry or mefSoamDmTcaCfgTable for a DM stateful entry.

        For a TCA CLEAR (statefulClear) five conditions need to be met:

        a) measurement of the parameter is enabled via the
           mefSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable for a LM TCA or
           mefSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable for a DM TCA; and

        b) the parameter threshold is configured in the mefSoamLmTcaCfgTable
           for LM TCA or mefSoamDmTcaCfgTable for DM TCA; and

        c) the TCA type is enabled via the mefSoamLmTcaCfgEnable
           or mefSoamDmTcaCfgEnable; and

        d) the measured value of the parameter did not exceed the value
           configured in the mefSoamLmTcaCfgClearValue for a LM stateful entry
           or mefSoamDmTcaCfgClearValue for a DM stateful entry for the
           Measurement Interval; and

        e) the measured value during the previous measurement interval did
           exceed the value configured in the mefSoamLmTcaCfgClearValue for
           a LM stateful entry or mefSoamDmTcaCfgClearValue for a DM stateful
           entry.

        In the case of thresholds applied to a maximum or average measurement
        counter, the previous measured value is the value of the counter at the
        end of the preceding Measurement Interval.  In the case of thresholds
        applied to the last measured value, it is the previous measured value.

        The management entity that receives the notification can identify
        the system from the network source address of the notification,
        and can identify the LM or DM session reporting the TCA
        by the indices in the mefSoamPmNotificationCfgThresholdId object,
        including dot1agCfmMdIndex, dot1agCfmMaIndex, dot1agCfmMepIdentifier,
        and the mefSoamLmCfgIndex or mefSoamDmCfgIndex.

        An agent is not to generate more than one mefSoamLmThresholdCrossingAlarm
        'notification-event' of a given type (stateless or stateful) per MEP per
        LM or DM session per TCA instance as specified by
        mefSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval. A 'notification-event' is the
        transmission of a single notification to a list of notification
        destinations.

        If additional TCA events occur within the
        mefSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval period, then notification
        generation for these changes are suppressed by the agent until
        the current alarm interval expires. At the end of an alarm interval
        period, one notification-event is generated if any TCA
        events occurred since the start of the alarm interval period.
        In such a case, another alarm interval period is started right away.
