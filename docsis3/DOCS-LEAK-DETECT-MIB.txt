     DESCRIPTION
         "This attribute communicates the current time that a single cycle takes to 
          complete. This calculation takes into account the configured test parameters
          (TransmitBurstGap, TransmitDuration, and TransmitCycleGap), the channel 
          configuration (OFDMA Frame Duration in milliseconds) and the NumBurstPositions 
          currently being used for the test. When the CmMacAddressList is explicitly configured,
          this value is static for the duration of the test. In the case where the CCAP determines
          and manages the list, this value can vary based on the number of modems that have been 
          configured and is updated each time modems are added to or deleted from the list. 
          The calculation in milliseconds is defined as
         
          CurrCycleTime = [<TransmitDuration> x NumBurstPositions + 
          <TransmitBurstGap> x (NumBurstPositions-1) + 
          TransmitCycleGap] x  OFDMA Frame Duration in milliseconds.
          
          Note that TransmitDuration, TransmitBurstGap, and TransmitCycleGap are defined in terms of
          OFDMA frames,  To get a value in terms of milliseconds, it is necessary to multiply the 
          number of OFDMA frames by the OFDMA frame duration in milliseconds. 
          The value of N is either the value of NumModems when the list of modems is configured, 
          or the number of modems that the CMTS has added to NumModemsActive when the CMTS manages 
          the list of modems."

          the position of the modem in the cycle should the modem come back online,
